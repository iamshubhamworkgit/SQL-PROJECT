# PIZZA SALES ANALYSIS

In this project, I delved into a comprehensive dataset to uncover trends and insights about pizza sales. By leveraging SQL, I was able to:

* Analyze sales performance across different time periods
* Identify top-selling pizza types and customer preferences
* Determine the contribution of different pizza types to total revenue.

The findings revealed valuable patterns that can inform marketing strategies and operational decisions.
